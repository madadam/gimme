Gimme
=====

Gimme is tiny utility for very simple task:

I want to work with a program. If the progam is already running, bring it to the front
and give it the focus. If not, run it.

It's intended to be mapped to global shortcuts, using means of your window manager or 
desktop environment. For example, you can map <Win+F> to "gimme firefox", so pressing
Win + F will always give firefox under your hands, no mattern if it is already running 
or not.

Usage
=====

  gimme name_of_program [program arguments]

Example
=======

Run/Activate firefox:

  gimme firefox

Activate gim or run it with stuff.txt argument:

  gimme gvim stuff.txt

Legal shit
