Gimme
=====

Gimme is tiny utility for very simple task:

I want to work with a program. If the progam is already running, bring it to the front and give it the focus. If not, run it.

It's intended to be mapped to global shortcuts, using means of your window manager or desktop environment of choice. For example, you can map <Win+F> to "gimme firefox", so pressing Win + F will always give firefox under your hands, no mattern if it is already running or not.

Usage
=====

  gimme name_of_program [program arguments]

Example
=======

Run/Activate firefox:

  gimme firefox

Activate gim or run it with stuff.txt argument:

  gimme gvim stuff.txt

Limitations
===========

Works only in linux (or POSIX compatible system) with X11 and a EWMH compliant window manager. 

The lookup is done over all top level windows, comparing their process name (if available) and window title. The comparison is a case-insensitive substring match, which means that, for example:

  gimme fire

will match firefox (if it's already running), or

  gimme wikipedia

will match firefox showing a wikipedia page (because it will have "Wikipedia" in it's title).


ToDo
====

Make the matching more configurable. Allow to match by process name, window class, 
window role, window title and any combination of them.
